When time runs out, the math problem and submission form disappears and a link to the total kitty count (final score) page appears.</p> <p> When user clicks on the "Click Here for Total Kitty Count" link, they can view their total kitty count along with a silly message associated with their score range.</p> <p> On the total kitty count page, the user is then given the option to go back to the game page and and try again.</p>',
