    description: '<p>Kitty Counter is a timed, math-based game where every correct answer causes a kitty to appear on screen. The user has 20 seconds to answer as many addition problems as possible. When time runs out, the math problem and submission form disappears and a link to the total kitty count (final score) page appears. When user clicks on the "Click Here for Total Kitty Count" link, they can view their total kitty count along with a silly message associated with their score range. On the total kitty count page, the user is then given the option to go back to the game page and and try again.</p>'
